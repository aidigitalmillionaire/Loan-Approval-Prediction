# 💰 Loan Approval Prediction

A machine learning project that predicts whether a loan application will be approved or rejected based on applicant details such as income, credit history, employment, and loan amount.
The model helps financial institutions make faster, data-driven lending decisions while minimizing risk.

# 🚀 Project Overview

This project leverages classification algorithms to predict loan approval status using real-world data from a bank’s loan records.
By analyzing applicant demographics and financial background, the model automates decision-making — reducing manual workload and improving loan screening accuracy.

# 🧠 Tech Stack

Language: Python 🐍

Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

Models Used: Logistic Regression / Random Forest / XGBoost

Dataset: Public loan data (e.g., Kaggle’s Loan Prediction Dataset)
